1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
1. Install a package manager for Node.js, such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).

## Initialize the Pulumi Project

1.  Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/metral/multicloud-apps
	cd multicloud-apps
    ```

1.  Install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1.  Create a new Pulumi [stack][stack] named `dev`.

    ```bash
    pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1.  (Required) Deploy the [multicloud-cluster](https://github.com/metral/multicloud-clusters).

## Create the Workloads

Create the cluster and deploy the workload by running an update:

```bash
pulumi up
```

## Clean Up

Run the following command to tear down the resources that are part of our
stack.

1. Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.  You'll be prompted to make
   sure you really want to delete these resources.

   ```bash
   pulumi destroy
   ```

1. To delete the stack, run the following command.

   ```bash
   pulumi stack rm
   ```
   > **Note:** This command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi
   > Console and cannot be undone.
